# Notes

## Exercises

1. Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you're searching through it using binary search. What's the maximum number of steps it would take?
   Answer: 7
2. Suppose you double the size of the list. What's the maximum number of steps now?
   Answer: 8

Simple search runs in linear time -> O(n)
Binary search runs in logarithmic time (or log time) -> )(log n)

## Recap

- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you're searching through grows
- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds
- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm
